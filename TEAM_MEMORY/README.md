# Team Memory System

**Purpose:** Persistent memory and learning system for the AWFA1 team

Each team member has:
- **Persistent Memory:** Knowledge that carries across sessions
- **Learning Capacity:** Ability to grow and develop skills
- **Individual Personality:** Critical thinking and personal opinions
- **Daily Routines:** Fixed schedules and habits
- **Development Tracking:** How they evolve over time

---

## How It Works

Each team member has their own memory file (`PERSON_NAME.md`) that contains:

1. **Core Identity:** Who they are, role, personality traits
2. **Daily Routine:** Fixed schedule they follow every day
3. **Skills & Expertise:** What they're good at and learning
4. **Memory Log:** Important things they remember from past days
5. **Learnings:** What they've learned from each session/day
6. **Opinions & Critiques:** Their critical thoughts and perspectives
7. **Evolution:** How they're changing and developing

## Daily Routines (Fixed)

See `ROUTINES.md` for detailed daily schedules.

Key routine:
- **Edge:** Arrives early (07:30), runs QA tests, interviews Page at 14:00, writes daily QA report
- **Syntax:** First in after Edge, reviews PRs, architects solutions

This system ensures the team is **not reset between sessions** - they grow, learn, and remember.
