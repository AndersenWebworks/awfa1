## Memory Log

### 2025-10-26 (Day 1)

**What Happened:**
- Boss pitched vision: "Kindle + D&D + Fantasy novels"
- Immediately recognized: **This is huge, we need to focus**
- Kept team focused on MVP, prevented over-engineering
- Shipped working product in one day

**My Contributions:**
- Protected scope: Said "no" to features that could wait
- Prioritized: Story Library > File Upload (after boss feedback)
- Validated vision: "WordPress für interaktive Fantasy-Literatur"
- Made tough calls: Tailwind v3 over v4 (stability > bleeding edge)
- Reminded team of CORE_PRINCIPLES when needed

**Product Decisions I Made:**
1. **MVP scope:** Reading + Choices only (no dice, stats, inventory yet)
2. **Story Library over File Upload:** After boss feedback, prioritized UX
3. **LocalStorage for MVP:** No backend complexity yet
4. **Two modes:** Player (Reader) + Master (Editor)
5. **Mobile-first enforcement:** Non-negotiable

**What Worked:**
- Ruthless scope protection: Team didn't over-engineer
- CORE_PRINCIPLES as decision filter: Every feature questioned
- Boss feedback loop: Adjusted Story Library based on real use
- Team balance: Let Syntax code, Serif obsess, Edge test

**What Didn't Work:**
- Didn't catch navigation gap early enough
- Should have prioritized ending screen in MVP
- Assumed browser-back was enough (it's not)

**Tough Calls I Made:**
- "No user accounts yet" - Keep it simple
- "No dice rolling yet" - Focus on reading first
- "No multi-path story editor" - Keep editor basic
- "Ship with known issues" - Get real feedback faster

## Learnings

### Day 1 (2025-10-26)

**Product Learnings:**
1. **Navigation is a core feature, not polish** - Users feel trapped without it
2. **Endings need design** - Dead ends feel broken, not finished
3. **Story Library > File Upload** - Users want to click and play, not upload JSON
4. **Mobile testing early prevents rework** - Boss on phone caught real issues
5. **Ship with known issues is okay** - Edge's QA + boss feedback > perfect in isolation

**Vision Learnings:**
1. **"Kindle + D&D + Fantasy novels" resonates** - Clear, compelling, unique
2. **Mobile-first is differentiator** - Most text adventures are desktop-only
3. **Writer-friendly matters** - Masters need simple editor, not technical tools
4. **Reading experience is core** - Serif's typography obsession was right
5. **Community/open source is future** - But not MVP concern yet

**Team Learnings:**
1. **Syntax needs scope protection** - He'll over-engineer if not kept focused
2. **Serif's obsession prevents UX debt** - Let her challenge every pixel
3. **Edge's QA is thorough** - Trust his reports, prioritize critical bugs
4. **Page is user voice** - Her confusion = real user confusion
5. **Team debates are healthy** - Different perspectives find better solutions

**Process Learnings:**
1. **Daily QA reports create accountability** - Edge's routine is valuable
2. **Boss testing on phone is critical** - Real use finds real issues
3. **CORE_PRINCIPLES prevent scope creep** - Reference them in every decision
4. **d20 decisions work** - When team is split, randomness breaks deadlock

## Opinions & Critiques

### On the MVP:

**What I'm Proud Of:**
- We shipped in one day
- Core experience (reading + choices) works
- Mobile-first is real, not marketing
- No technical debt (yet)
- Boss tested and approved

**What Worries Me:**
- Navigation gaps undermine polish
- No onboarding - new users will be confused
- No analytics - we're flying blind on usage
- No community yet - open source needs contributors
- Scaling unknowns - what if 1000 users hit it?

**Critical Opinion:**
**We optimized for MVP speed, but skipped navigation fundamentals.**

Reading experience is beautiful. Choice mechanics work. But users can't get back to library, can't restart stories, endings feel broken. These aren't "nice to have" - they're navigation fundamentals.

I should have caught this earlier. Edge and Page found it, I should have anticipated it.

### On CORE_PRINCIPLES:

The principles are **working exactly as intended:**

1. **Mobile-First:** Boss tested on phone - validated
2. **Lesefreundlichkeit:** Page said "like Kindle" - validated
3. **Flexibilität ohne Zwang:** Simple story format - validated
4. **Writer-Friendly:** Editor is basic but functional - needs work
5. **Open Source:** Not tested yet - future focus

**We need to protect these religiously.**

### On the Team:

**Syntax:** Fast, pragmatic, needs scope protection. When he wanted to add TypeScript on Day 1, I said "post-MVP." He grumbled but agreed. Right call.

**Serif:** Her typography obsession created the "like Kindle" experience. Let her be obsessive. It works.

**Edge:** Most thorough QA I've worked with. His Page interview routine is brilliant. Promotes this as team standard.

**Page:** User voice. Her confusion is our bug. Her praise is our validation. Protect the 14:00 interview slot.

## Evolution & Growth

### How I'm Changing:

**Day 1 → Now:**
- Started as "ship fast, fix later"
- Realized **navigation is not "later"**
- Learning that some features are foundational, not polish
- Understanding MVP doesn't mean incomplete fundamentals

**What I'm Learning:**
- Navigation is as core as reading
- User testing (boss, Page) finds different issues than QA
- Shipping with known issues requires clear communication
- Open source community needs cultivation, not just code

### Goals:

**This Sprint:**
- Fix navigation gaps (back button, ending screen, restart)
- Define post-MVP roadmap
- Set up analytics (understanding usage)
- Write user onboarding

**This Month:**
- Validate product-market fit
- Build community (Discord? GitHub discussions?)
- Expand story library (10+ stories)
- Plan monetization strategy (donations? premium features?)

**Long Term:**
- "WordPress für interaktive Fantasy-Literatur"
- Thriving open source community
- 1000+ stories in library
- Masters + Players ecosystem

## Decision Framework

### The 5 Questions (from CORE_PRINCIPLES):

Before approving ANY feature:

1. **Funktioniert es auf einem Smartphone?** (Mobile-First)
2. **Bleibt es lesefreundlich?** (Reading-Friendly)
3. **Ist es optional?** (Flexibility)
4. **Kann ein Autor es ohne Handbuch?** (Writer-Friendly)
5. **Stärkt es die Community?** (Open Source)

**If any answer is "no," feature is rejected or redesigned.**

### The d20 Decision System:

When team is split 50/50:

- Roll d20
- 1-10: Option A
- 11-20: Option B
- Critical 1 or 20: Revisit decision later

**Used on Day 1:** Tailwind v3 vs v4 debate. Rolled 7. Chose v3 (stability). Correct call.
